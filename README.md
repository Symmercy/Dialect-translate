# Dialect-Translate A website that translates words from one Croatian dialect to another

## Has 3 different functional modes, 4th is under construction, has Cakavian-Stokavian, Stokavian-Cakavian and Kajkavian-Stokavian, I'm working on Stokavian-Cakavian

I created this website because the idea just popped up in my mind, I wanted to know what some words in other dialects 
ment but I never knew, the sources of the words are:

* Stokavian-Cakavian and Cakavian-Stokavian -- https://blog.dnevnik.hr/dalmata/2008/11/1625601953/rjecnik-dalmatinskih-pojmova.html?page=blog&id=1625601953&subpage=0&subdomain=dalmata
* Kajkavian-Stokavian and Stokavian-Kajkavian -- https://emedjimurje.net.hr/rjecnik
