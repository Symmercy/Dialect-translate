# Dialect-Translate A website that translates words from one Croatian dialect to another

## A tool to help you translate between Croatian dialects

There are 3 working modes (will be 4 at the end), there are stokavian-cakavian, cakavian-stokavian, kajkavian-stokavian (I'm working on stokavian-cakavian)

I created this website because the idea just popped up in my mind, I wanted to know what some words in other dialects 
ment but I never knew, the sources of the words are:

* Stokavian-Cakavian and Cakavian-Stokavian -- https://blog.dnevnik.hr/dalmata/2008/11/1625601953/rjecnik-dalmatinskih-pojmova.html?page=blog&id=1625601953&subpage=0&subdomain=dalmata
* Kajkavian-Stokavian and Stokavian-Kajkavian -- https://emedjimurje.net.hr/rjecnik
